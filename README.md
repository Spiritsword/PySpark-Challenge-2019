This challenge was completed to win entry into a data engineering conference.
The purpose was to analyse a dataset of posts from the Hacker News site using PySpark.
spark_rdd.py is the solution file of specified functions.
There is also a Jupyter notebook, spark_rdd-homework.ipynb, in which the functions were originally created and tried out. (NB sometimes there is a conflict between the specs provided in the notebook and those provided in spark_rdd.py.)
The sample dataset has not been uploaded to GitHub because of its large size.
